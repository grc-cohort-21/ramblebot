On the road through the dark night
You're on your own with no one to hear you
Going fast but it's alright
You're on your own with nothing to hold you back
And now you've driven past the red lights
Behind your shades all the colors seem faded
And now you're moving at the speed of light
I'll lead you home tonight
When you're tired of the dark nights
And need someone to hold
I'll be your fire in the cold rain
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
When you're tired of the dark nights
And need someone to hold
I'll be your fire in the cold rain

When you're tired of the dark nights
And need someone to hold
I'll be your fire in the cold rain
When you're tired of the dark nights
And need someone to hold
I'll be your fire in the cold rain
I'm never gonna let you go

Head on the dashboard
I can see that your heart is breakin'
I wish wish I could fast forward
Take all of your pain and erase it
Feet on the ground feet on the ground
Even when we're upside down
'Round and around
But we're never fallin out
If the world is goin sideways
I know my place is here with you
When all our good nights turn to dark days
I know I'll stay next to you
When your hope's gone can barely hold on
When your sky is runnin out of blue
When the world is goin sideways
I'll be sideways
Sideways here with you
No sideways here with you no
When the world is goin sideways
I'll be sideways
Sideways here with you
Sideways here with you
No sideways here with you no
Sideways here with you
Don't disappear
You know all of your bad news won't be news to me
Echoes all I hear
Scared of findin nothin where you used to be
Feet on the ground feet on the ground
Even when we're upside down
'Round and around
But we're never fallin out
If the world is goin sideways
I know my place is here with you
When all our good nights turn to dark days
I know I'll stay next to you
When your hope's gone can barely hold on
When your sky is runnin out of blue
When the world is goin sideways
I'll be sideways
Sideways here with you
No sideways here with you no
When the world is goin sideways
I'll be sideways
Sideways here with you
Sideways here with you
No sideways here with you no
Sideways here with you
No sideways here with you no

Do you remember
When we were kids and
We were runnin free?
Have we forgotten
What it feels like
To feel the sun beneath our skin

Why are you hidin'
All that you are and
All that you've got to give?
I know you're tired
I know you're hurting
I know this life can sting

Slow it down
Take a breath it's alright
Look around don't forget you're alive
Look around don't forget you're alive
Don't let the little things pass you by
This is the gift of time

Take a breath it's alright
Take a breath it's alright

When you feel burned out and it gets heavy
When all is lost and you feel so empty
Can you listen to what is really true?

Slow it down
Take a breath it's alright
Don't let the little things pass you by
This is the gift of time

All we have is this moment
All we have is right now
All we are are these bodies
Feel your feet on the ground
And if your heart is beatin'
Know it is for a reason
All we have is this moment
All we have is right now

Hey
Just seeing how you're doing
I just wanted to say that I miss you I guess
And I'm sorry
Call me back
Bye
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel now
Sixty over the limit just cause I can
They say You know you gotta slow down
There's no coming back
So young and restless I'm a clich√© yeah
But it's easier said than done
And I can't keep waiting here I'm just aging
So I'm gone such a shame but
Baby I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in
Saying I'm never coming home
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known
Still falling in and falling out fast
I'm burning up
Can't believe this got old so fast
And I'm done with feeling like I'm told I should
'Cause it's a feeling I'm chasing
And I ain't found it here in a while
But I can't keep waiting here I'm just aging
So I'm gone such a shame but
Baby I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in
Saying I'm never coming home
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving

Like a faded memory
You'll always have a piece of me
I almost gave you everything and more
Fell for you like pouring rain
But somehow we got washed away
There's something that my heart's still waiting for
I will smile and say I'm moving on
But my heart betrays me in a song
And I know I can't let go
And if you asked me how I really feel
Would I even tell you that it's real? Would I hide deep inside?
In my mind
In my mind
It's still you and I you and I
In my mind
'Cause we never said goodbye
We never said goodbye oh
'Cause we never said goodbye
We never said goodbye oh
In my mind
In my mind
It's still you and I you and I
In my mind
I don't know how a single word
Can hold you when it's left unheard
Even when I know we're worlds apart
And if I could turn back the days
Is there something that I'd change
Or am I just in love with dreaming of your face?
'Cause if you asked me how I really feel
Would I even tell you that it's real?
Would I hide deep inside?
In my mind in my mind
It's still you and I you and I
In my mind
'Cause we never said goodbye
We never said goodbye oh
We never said goodbye
We never said goodbye oh
In my mind in my mind
We never said goodbye
We were so bright
Standing in the sunlight
Never got burnt we were alright
Had that easy kind of love and I let it in
For a moment
Felt like we were floating
Baby I swear we were golden
It was easy natural as breathing air
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go
Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
And tell me how to crawl outta love
Tell me how to
Now I gotta crawl outta crawl outta love
Tell me how to
Now I gotta crawl outta crawl outta love
Got your words right
Always knew what to say in our fights
Look at us now hard as I try
I get halfway up the wall and you pull me down
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go
Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
Tell me how to crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta crawl outta love
Tell me how to
Now I gotta crawl outta crawl outta love
Crawl outta crawl outta
Crawl outta crawl outta love
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go
Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
Tell me how to crawl outta love
Now I gotta
Tell me how to crawl outta crawl outta love
Tell me how to
Now I gotta crawl outta crawl outta love


To give all the love that I need
But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes
Lead me home
When I don't know which way is right
Love me when it's hard I promise that I'm not
Leaving from your side
And when I fall apart promise in the dark
You'll be my nightlight ooh
I could count
Every time that I've fallen
Even when I'm in so deep
It gets hard to see you're still all in
I've been lost by myself in the darkness
Know that I can find my way
Even on the days when it's hardest
But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes
Lead me home
When I don't know which way is right
Love me when it's hard I promise that I'm not
Leaving from your side
And when I fall apart promise in the dark
You'll be my nightlight ooh

Can't see the stars but we're reaching
Trying to get through the dark on a feeling
Lost our gravity now we're weightless
But I know in my heart we can take this
We got monsters in our closets
Had a reason but we lost it
No direction we've been calling through the night
Through the night
If love is a lie then why do we need it?
We swear we're alive but we're falling to pieces
We fight like lions
We howl at the moon
We should be flying
Instead we bury the truth
But I know inside we're beautiful creatures
We're beautiful creatures
When your highs are low keep the faith yeah
'Cause you know that a life's never wasted
Standing tall shaking off the dust
Now we know now we know what we're made of
We got monsters in our closets
Had a reason but we lost it
No direction we've been calling through the night
Through the night
If love is a lie then why do we need it?
We swear we're alive but we're falling to pieces
We fight like lions
We howl at the moon
We should be flying
Instead we bury the truth

I miss the ways you would say you wanted me
Call me over pull me closer
And kiss me like you and I were 17
Why does it seem like you don't remember?
You call me when you're coming down
Say you'll never let me down
Those nights you'd try to calm me down
Even though I know you're just saying that
Those are words you can't take back
This is for the hearts on fire
Outta control 
Boy you gotta let em know
This is for the hearts on fire 
Singing alone 
There's only one way to know
I wish you could read my mind 
Or give me a sign 
Or tell me you wanted to be mine 
This is for the hearts on fire 
Singing alone 
There's only one way to know ah
I wish you could read my mind 
Or give me a sign 
Or tell me you wanted to be mine 
This is for the hearts on fire 
Singing alone 
There's only one way to know ah
I miss the days you would ask me anything
Say you know me do you want me?
But now you got me looking back and wondering
Maybe I act like it's nothing to me
You call me when you're coming down
Say you'll never let me down
Those nights you'd try to calm me down
Even though I know you're just saying that
Those are words you can't take back
This is for the hearts on fire
Outta control
Boy you gotta let em know
This is for the hearts on fire
Singing alone
There's only one way to know
I wish you could read my mind
Or give me a sign
Or tell me you wanted to be mine
This is for the hearts on fire 
Singing alone
There's only one way to know ah
I wish you could read my mind 
Or give me a sign
Or tell me you wanted to be mine
This is for the hearts on fire 
Singing alone
There's only one way to know ah

I didn't mean to hurt you when I hurt myself
It's just an empty voice screaming out for help
No I didn't mean to scare you
But I couldn't see that when I went to hell
I was taking you with me
When I close my eyes
I'm climbing in the dark
Trying not to fall apart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me
Take you down
Take you down with me
Don't wanna take you down take you down
Take you
Down with me
This life is like a razor
When it cuts I bleed
But it's in my hand
And I'm doing it to me
Sometimes it's like an ocean
And it gets too deep
There's no way that now you could rescue me
When I close my eyes
I'm fighting in the dark
Trying not to break your heart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me
You need to let it go now
Before you drown
I know that you won't understand
But you need to let go of these hands
'Cause I'm going now
And I don't wanna take you down with me
And I don't wanna take you down with me
Take you down down with me

Won't you let me love the lonely out of you out of you?
Won't you let me love the lonely out of you out of you?

If you only loved yourself
Don't take it out on someone else ooh ooh
If you knew what love was worth
It'd bring your head back down to earth ooh ooh

You used to touch me like you never felt a thing
I was talking to myself when I thought you were listening
You could've left before was it fun watching me bleed?
Were you taking your time when you left your scars on me?


Burning everything I know
Desperate for a change
Crashing down the ancient roads
Past our yesterday
Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it shattering collide
Call me post-traumatic now it's do or die
Coming after tiny fractures
Coming after tiny fractures
See me running full speed at it
Coming after tiny fractures
Call me post-traumatic
What comes after tiny fractures
What comes after
Feeding frenzy is in my brain
I'm hopeful every day yeah
I gotta get it while we are still young enough to break
We're finally not afraid
Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it shattering collide
Call it post-traumatic now it's do or die
Coming after tiny fractures
Coming after tiny fractures
See me running full speed at it
Coming after tiny fractures
Call me post-traumatic
What comes after tiny fractures
