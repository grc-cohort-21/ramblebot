Beneath the moon’s pale, spectral glow, where shadows stretch and whispers grow, a mournful dirge, the night does weave, through haunted boughs, where spirits grieve. The air is thick with dread and gloom, the earth itself a waiting tomb, and in the wind, a wraithlike sigh, a cry for those condemned to die. A raven perched on marble bare, its piercing eyes, a fiery stare, it spoke no word, it gave no call, yet dread it cast upon us all. The bell of midnight, cold, resounds, a sound that echoes all around, and from the depths of time it rings, a harbinger of darker things. The flicker of the candle’s light does cast a shadow, ghastly sight, as phantoms dance, their eyes aglow, in halls where no man dares to go. The silence whispers secrets deep, of things that crawl, and things that creep, of nameless horrors, veiled in mist, in the corners of the mind, they twist. The clock ticks on with eerie grace, each beat a marker of disgrace, and in the stillness, hearts do freeze, as death itself begins to tease. The raven stirs, its wings unfold, and with a whisper, sharp and cold, it beckons forth the final night, to steal the soul, to end the fight. No breath remains, no voice to plead, for in the dark, all life shall bleed. Upon the winds, a mournful cry, as souls of lost ones start to fly, they hover near the earth’s dark soil, bound by grief, and bound by toil. And in the silence of the grave, they rest not, for they long to rave, to shout against the skies that weep, for the forgotten ones who sleep. Beneath the surface, there’s a stir, as bodies of the lost confer, and from the depths, a cold hand reaches, its fingers pale as moonlight breaches. A shudder runs through all the trees, as if they sense the coming freeze, the deathly stillness, calm yet loud, that speaks in voices of the crowd. And in the darkest corners creep, the memories that never sleep, they crawl upon the heart and mind, entwining, leaving none behind. The night consumes all light and sound, as shadows spread upon the ground, and in the hollows, whispers rise, the sorrowed moans of ancient lies. The specters call to those still here, beckoning them to disappear, to join the realms where none return, where fires of torment ceaseless burn. The raven stares with knowing eyes, as souls descend, as life denies the final grace, the final peace, for in the dark, there’s no release. The wind grows colder with each breath, as voices speak the word of death, and in the silence of the tomb, there’s only darkness, only doom. The moon is high, a silver blade, and in its light, the dead are laid, their faces pale, their eyes aglow, for they have seen what none can know. The bells toll out with hollow sound, and in their chime, the lost are bound to wander evermore in dread, for those who die shall be the dead. The raven’s wings, a sweeping dark, they stir the air, they leave their mark upon the silent world below, a reminder of the endless woe. Beneath the earth, the worms do crawl, the creatures dark, the insects small, they feast upon the rotting flesh, as life decays in death’s cruel mesh. And though the world may rise anew, beneath the soil, the shadows grew, for death is but a fleeting dream, a whisper in the eternal scream. The raven’s call, it pierces deep, as souls descend and others weep, for in the depths, they know the cost, that all who live are bound to lost. The wind, it howls with bitter cry, as stars above begin to die, and in the blackened heavens torn, the moon reveals its ghastly form. The night does stretch its endless arms, enfolding all within its charms, the world of life, the world of light, now consumed by endless night. And in the quiet, still and cold, the stories of the lost are told, not in words, but in the dark, where shadows leave their endless mark. And so it is, that none shall find a refuge from the tortured mind, for in the grave, there is no rest, no solace, nor a place to rest. The raven soars across the skies, its eyes aglow with sorrowed lies, and in its wake, the winds do moan, for all are lost, and all alone. The world is cold, the night is near, the future shrouded in despair, and in the dark, there lies a truth, one known to all in bitter youth. The ghostly figures, draped in white, they march through halls of endless night, their steps are slow, their faces grim, their voices lost in hopeless hymn. Beneath the earth, the graves are wide, the restless dead, they cannot hide, they rise again with cursed cries, their eyes alight with hopeless sighs. The wind it speaks, in twisted form, a voice that rides upon the storm, and in its wake, the heavens tear, a cosmic howl that fills the air. The shadows writhe beneath the stars, as if they seek to breach the bars of life, of death, of time, of space, to leave their mark upon this place. And in the depths, the ravens call, as midnight strikes and shadows fall, and in their wake, the world is gone, the night eternal, all alone. The moon is dark, the stars are pale, as endless winds begin to wail, and in the stillness, none shall find the peace that haunts the tortured mind. For in the end, all life shall cease, and in the dark, there is no peace.
