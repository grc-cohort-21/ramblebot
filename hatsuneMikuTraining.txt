C'mon, I feel like there's something about this song
It's like we knew how it'd go all along.
So put down your worries and raise your cups
There's nowhere to go but up.
Let's dance!
With a rhythm from New York to Japan
Know you'll never be alone.
At first glance we're miles away
But our hearts are connected
Through these soundwaves.
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
Cut through the clouds
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
We're never coming down.
Jump, jump without a doubt.
Nothing but up, up, up yeah!
Intergalactic bound
Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh Oh Hey! Hey!
Intergalactic bound
Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh Oh Hey! Hey!
Intergalactic bound
If you're an oldie
Or fresh on the scene. uh huh.
Come put your lights up
We'll make a wave of green. woo!
To us all here and now. uh huh.
Just take a deep breath
And let me hear you shout! yay!
Let's groove with the static in the air
A breakthrough that can bring us anywhere.
It's your move so take the lead
From the crowd to the stage.
What sights can we see?
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
Cut through the clouds
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
We're never coming down.
Jump, jump without a doubt
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
Intergalactic bound
A thousand little voices sing
It's a fiesta from now on.
With our playthings always by our side
To help us make this song.
Through the dark of the night
I know we will be alright
There's a universe of positivity
Beyond the sky.
Ten thousand of the stars
They will keep on burning bright
With this light held between you and I
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
Cut through the clouds
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
We're never coming down
Jump, jump without a doubt
Nothing but up, up, up. yeah!
Intergalactic bound
Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh Oh Hey! Hey!
Intergalactic bound
Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh Oh Hey! Hey!
Intergalactic bound
