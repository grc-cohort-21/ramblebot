Slow down
Give yourself the run around
And just hold your horses
Outlaw external forces

And float above the boys in the gray suits
I know you like the rush
But the comedowns yet to come

Trudge through the electro madness
Buckle bunny Im behind you
Those machines for killing fascists
They dont make them like they used to 
And when the comedown catches me
Before I catch myself

Ride them in my baby
Dont you try to save me

And float above the boys in the gray suits
I know you like the rush
But the comedowns yet to come

Trudge through the electro madness
Buckle bunny Im behind you
Those machines for killing sadness
They dont make them like they used to 
And when the comedown catches me
Before I catch myself

Ride them in my baby
Dont you try to save me

Youll never crack my crescendo
Vanta blackout with my soul sister
Through the false love out the window
Tie me down forever and a day I dont care

Youll never crack my crescendo
Vanta blackout with my soul sister
Through the false love out the window
Tie me down forever and a day I dont care

Honeymoon radiation
Im gonna burn it down for good
Go for broke, as country folk
Never thinking about if we should

Honeymoon radiation
Im gonna burn it down for good
Go for broke, as country folk
Never thinking about if we should

Youll never crack my crescendo
Vanta blackout with my soul sister
Through the false love out the window
Tie me down forever and a day I dont care
