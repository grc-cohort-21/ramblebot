the world so fall beneath the same oh you cause i follow the coldness from your energy to life they don't know where..
you're falling through the distance in front of the way and i'll be let it falls away save me alive i will travel the walls
you radiating energy has set me shine on the word i'd make me to hear me your light and i won't come down to you supernova:
we'll fuse when the silence now i seek afraid of night, you breathe in seas of your bluff now they only one in the more
