  /**
   * Predicts the next word based on the given context.
   * The prediction is made by randomly selecting from all words 
   * that follow the last word in the context in the training data.
   * 
   * For example:
   * If the input text is: "The cat sat. The cat slept. The dog barked."
   * 
   * The resulting map (neighborMap) would be:
   * {
   *   "the" -> ["cat", "cat", "dog"],
   *   "cat" -> ["sat", "slept"],
   *   "sat" -> ["."],
   *   "." -> ["the", "the"],
   *   "slept" -> ["."],
   *   "dog" -> ["barked"],
   *   "barked" -> ["."]
   * }
   * 
   * When predicting the next word given a context, the predictor should use 
   * the neighbor map to select a word based on the observed frequencies in 
   * the training data. For example:
   * 
   * - If the last word in the context is "the", the next word should be randomly chosen 
   *   from ["cat", "cat", "dog"]. In this case, "cat" has a 2/3 probability 
   *   of being selected, and "dog" has a 1/3 probability, reflecting the 
   *   original distribution of words following "the" in the text.
   * 
   * - If the last word in the context is "cat", the next word should be randomly chosen 
   *   from ["sat", "slept"], giving each an equal 1/2 probability.
   * 
   * - If the last word in the context is ".", the next word should be randomly chosen 
   *   from ["the", "the"], meaning "the" will always be selected 
   *   since it's the only option.
   * 
   * - If the last word in the context is "dog", the next word should be "barked" because 
   *   "barked" is the only word that follows "dog" in the training data.
   * 
   * The probabilities of selecting each word should match the relative 
   * frequencies of the words that follow in the original training data. 
   * 
   * @param context a list of words representing the current context
   * @return the predicted next word, or null if no prediction can be made
