The more I fight, the more I work
The more I dig into the dirt
To be fed up, to be let down
To somehow turn it all around
But then fate knocks me to my knees
And sets new heights beyond my reach
Below the earth, below concrete
The whole world shackled to my feet

Then it falls away
Into the great escape
Over walls and weights
This antigravity taking over me

And far below, the carnivores
Are looking up to where I soar
Above the clouds, above the storm
Above the earth I am transformed
The energy has set me free
And pulled me through the galaxy
I've risen up beyond the sky
I am awake, I am alive

As it falls away
Into the great escape
Over walls and weights
This antigravity
Let it fly through the universe
Into the outer space
Over walls and weights
This antigravity taking over me

I won't come down
If you wanna break free
You know where to find me
If you wanna break free
You know where You know where...
If you wanna break free
You know where to find me
If you wanna break free
You know where...

Then it falls away
Into the great escape
Over walls and weights
This antigravity
Let it fly through the universe
Into the outer space
Over walls and weights
This antigravity taking over me

If you wanna break free
You know where to find me
If you wanna break free
You know where You know where...
Anti-gravity
Anti-gravity
Anti-gravity


I can see you running, running
Every night from the same darkness
It's coming, coming
But you are not alone
If you just say the word
I'll be there by your side
You make me more
You make me superhuman
And if you need me to
I will save you

Send out the signal and I'll fly low
If it means the death of me, I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo
Your halo
Halo

When you're backed against the wall
I could be the one who's always there to break your fall
You are not alone
You're the sun, you're the day
The light that guides me through
Never run, run away
I will save you

Send out the signal and I'll fly low
If it means the death of me
I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

Send out the signal and I'll fly low
If it means the death of me
I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo
Your halo
Your halo

I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go

And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo
Your halo

And we were bold
Over the world
We were flying through the satellites
We had ahold
Of the lightning strikes
When we should have been afraid of heights
And I was trying just to get you
And now I'm dying to forget you
Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
So I left the sky
And I fell behind

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

If I was whole
I'd turn right now
I'd forget it and just walk away
Cause I've been told
That I'm dragging it out
But I've been dying just to see your face
And all I wanted was to say "goodbye"
Into the fortress and you're stuck behind
And in the silence now I realize
That after all I built the wall

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

All these broken souls
They never make me whole
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart

All these broken souls
Each one more beautiful
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart

I'll send out my soul
To worlds more beautiful
But they won't, they won't know my heart
It's the darkest part

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

Darkening skies
Coming this way
Falling behind
Into nothing

But if you lead I will follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in outer space

Satellite
Shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite
Are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me

Shine on me

Blinded I wait
The end is forming
You are my fate
Give me warning

If you lead I will follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in outer space

Satellite
Shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite
Are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me

Shine on me

Far across the emptiness I walk the night
And search the silence in the dark you left behind
I seek the stars above the worlds to be the guides
But they are pale against the light in your eyes

In your eyes

And I won't suppose to know why you walked away
But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space
So send your energy to me and I'll push through
Send your signal home and bring me back to you

Satellite
Shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity
I will stay and never leave
My satellite
Are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me

Shine on me

There's something in the air
Burning ions in the oxygen are all aglow
A feeling everywhere
Premonitions of the storm that comes
But I won't go

I'm done running towards
The eyes of tornadoes
Pretending this is home

I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change

Been frozen since that day
I saw my clear blue skies
As they turned to gray in front of me
It's hard to find my way
Can I rise above
When giving up is all I know?

I'm done running towards
The eyes of tornadoes
Pretending this is hope

I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change

And the water's rising
Going deaf from the sound of rain
And the water's rising
I won't drown in the flood you made
And the water's rising
Going deaf from the sound of rain
And the water's rising
I won't drown in the flood you made

I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again

I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it wash over my fear
Of these heights as I transcend
And become whole again
I breathe in the atmosphere
Let it take me out of here
I won't live life in the rain
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change
Waiting on the sky to change

Waiting on the sky to change

Stardust
In you and in me
Fuse us
Into unity
Primeval
We're coupled
Born from the universe
Farewell
The void is calling
Don't fear
For futures and dreams
They're fleeting, retreating
It's ok
I promise

I don't know what to say
But I'm going to want you till the stars evaporate
We're only here for just a moment in the light
One day it shines for us the next we're in the night
So say the word and I'll be running back to find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight
Of your starlight

Tell me
Just tell me to stay
I'll turn
I won't look away
I'll stay here
I'll never go but you don't feel the same
Farewell
Farewell and godspeed
Light years
Between you and me
I'm fading
Your beauty conquers the darkness

At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And I'll fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight

Don't leave me lost here forever
Show me your starlight and pull me through
Don't leave me lost here forever
I need your starlight and pull me through
Bring me back to you

At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And I'll fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight

Fell out of the air and you broke your wings
Like you're doing every other time
Made a new pair out of broken things
To give it all another try
And you climb right up
To the highest peaks
And reach out to the edge of the world you seek
Afraid of heights
So you don't believe
You could ever be good enough

Go on then, Icarus
Take your turn
You always fly right up
Until it burns
Your wings
You never could change
Always the victim
Into the flames again
Go on then, Icarus
Take your turn
You'll never go through them

Head in the clouds buried
Your feet in the ground telling
Yourself it's the world that holds you down
But you've got your
Chin held high
And your chest pumped up
The replica of a runner-up
You were made for skies
But you called your bluff
Now you'll never be good enough

Go on then, Icarus
Take your turn
You always fly right up
Until it burns
Your wings
You never could change
Always the victim
Into the flames again
Go on then, Icarus
Take your turn
You'll never go through them

You'll never go through them
You'll never go through them

So fall back down, back down again
Got your head in the clouds on the ground again
Looking for a scapegoat to hold your feet
Pounding on your chest so you don't feel weak
You fall back down, back down again

Go on then, Icarus
Take your turn
You always fly right up
Until it burns
Your wings
You never could change
Always the victim
Into the flames again
Go on then, Icarus
Take your turn
You'll never go through them

Sometime long ago
We dreamed out of windows
Then we grew shields
And walls are all we seek
One time there was hope
It drifts away so slow
In poppy fields
We've all been put to sleep
I won't sleep again

Thunder in my head
But I'm done waiting for rainbows
My slumber won't end
Hiding in the shadows
Living with eyes wide open
Swimming into the light
I follow the path I've chosen
Out where there are dreams alive
I know I can't fix what's broken
If I just pretend to try
I follow the path I've chosen
Searching in the endless night
Dreamcatcher

Through this looking glass
I turn and I look back
It's hide-and-seek
I don't know which one's me
Counting sheep again
The plans of mice and men
If I fall asleep
Tell me that you'll wake me
Will you wake me?

Nightmares in my head
They have come back to haunt me
I won't run again
With you there's no worry

Living with eyes wide open
Swimming into the light
I follow the path I've chosen
Out where there are dreams alive
I know I can't fix what's broken
If I just pretend to try
I follow the path I've chosen
Searching in the endless night
Dreamcatcher

Along the way I started to sleep
And ran from the nightmares inside
But I will not let the shadows in me
Trap me alive
I'm bringing my dark to the light

Living with eyes wide open
Swimming into the light
I follow the path I've chosen
Out where there are dreams alive
I know I can't fix what's broken
If I just pretend to try
I follow the path I've chosen
Searching in the endless night
Dreamcatcher

Prepare the diving bell
It's time to take this low again
I sink into myself, low
No need for farewell
I know you always understand

Sorry there's no place for you inside the solitude
Just stay up here until I'm back again
I swear I'll be there for you
I swear I'll follow through
Stay the course and keep the ship manned

I was certain if I fell through the bottom
You'd be happy just to float here on your own
I was never quite prepared for the long ride, oh
Away, away, away, alone

Oh, this wasn't in my plans
Abandoned ship and headed for the sand
Oh, the albatross crash-lands
I've got the sinking feeling that I never can go home

If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?

Prepare the diving bell
Maybe just for a spell, again
As far as I can tell
Oh, you knew me too well
I miss you there when I descend

Sorry, there's no place for you inside the solitude
Just stay up here until I'm back again

Oh, this wasn't in my plans
Abandoned ship and headed for the sand
Oh, the albatross crash-lands
I've got the sinking feeling that I never can go home

If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?
If I stare into the abyss
Will it stare into me?

In my mind, endless sea
Calling from the bottom, but you don't hear me
Send your line down to me
Meet me on the surface
I will never leave

In my mind, endless sea
Calling from the bottom but you don't hear me
Send your line down to me
Meet me on the surface
I will never leave

Just one time, all I need
Calling from the bottom but you don't hear me
Stuck in time, stuck in me
Broken on the bottom like a refugee

Wake me when the new day comes
Together we will ride the sun
The future is an empty gun
We ride on to them one-by-one

Wake me when the new day comes
Together we will ride the sun
The future is an empty gun
We ride on to them one-by-one

Wake me when the new day comes
Together we will ride the sun
The future is an empty gun
We ride on to them one-by-one
One-by-one

You come in waves
Till you're all I know
Then you fade away
Into nothing
Weighed down by dark matter inside
You leave me frozen
You leave me frozen in time
In your

Everglow
You'll never know
The beauty I see when you open your shadows
Everglow
They'll never know
The worlds that I see in the darkness you don't show

Falling through a landslide
Feeling like the first time I felt you
Caught inside the field lines
That pull me to the land mines inside you
Black hole eyes won't gaze now
Drawn in just the same
You leave me frozen
You leave me frozen inside

Everglow
You'll never know
The beauty I see when you open your shadows
Everglow
They'll never know
The worlds that I see in the darkness you don't show

Come
I'll show every ghost in me
Take my pain into you...

I cut you into pieces
Searching for your imperfections
I had plans to make you whole
But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
Then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Breathe back life into your veins
But I can't start your cold heart beating
You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
Then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

And you left me more dead
Than you'll ever know
When you left me alone

I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way,
Then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

Mayday! Mayday!
The ship is slowly sinking
They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling
They're all around me,
Circling like vultures
They wanna break me and wash away my colors
Wash away my colors

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
'Kay, Okay, Okay
We are one in the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
'Way, away, away
Save me if I become
My demons

I cannot stop this sickness taking over
It takes control and drags me into nowhere
I need your help, I can't fight this forever
I know you're watching,
I can feel you out there

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
'Kay, Okay, Okay
We are one in the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
'Way, away, away
Save me if I become
My demons

Take me over the walls below
Fly forever
Don't let me go
I need a savior to heal my pain
When I become my worst enemy
The enemy

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay
We are one in the same
Oh you take all of the pain away

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
'Kay, Okay, Okay
We are one in the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
'Way, away, away
Save me if I become
My demons

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
'Kay, Okay, Okay
We are one in the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
'Way, away, away
Save me if I become
My demons

Tired eyes, barely open
Crippled by a promise broken
I have seen an empire falling
Hopeless, can you hear me calling?
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

Searching through the darkness below
For a light in seas of shadows
Far from you, but I could never
Abdicate, I'll fight forever
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

I will not run
I will not fall
I will not bury it
This is war!
War!
This is war!
War!

Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here
Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again
Ooooo

All my life they let me know
How far I would not go,
But inside the beast still grows,
Waiting, chewing through the ropes.

Who are you to change this world?
Silly boy!
No one needs to hear your words.
Let it go.

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am.
Bring it to an end.

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am.
Everything I am.

I will hide myself below.
I'll be what you wanted.
Kept inside, I won't let go
'Til I burn beyond control.

Who are you to change this world?
Silly boy!
No one needs to hear your words.
Let it go.

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am.
Bring it to an end.

Make me fall. Make me bleed.
Go ahead and change me!
Take away everything I am.
Everything I am.

Never enough.
Who I am is not good enough.
Never enough.
Who I am.

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am.
Bring it to an end.

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am.
Everything I am.

You're out there
I hear you calling from behind the star fields
I feel you
Radiating energy like eternal northern lights

Far from the sun
Where no one knows
I've watched you from
My telescope

I will travel the distance in your eyes
Interstellar light years from you
Supernova: we'll fuse when we collide
Awaking in the light of all the stars aligned

I see you
Washing over me across the sky
Overcoming
Projected on my eyes eternally
I find you in the night

Far from the sun
Where no one knows
I've watched you from
My telescope

I will travel the distance in your eyes
Interstellar light years from you
Supernova: we'll fuse when we collide
Awaking in the light of all the stars aligned

I will find you…

I will travel the distance in your eyes
Interstellar light years from you
Supernova: we'll fuse when we collide
Awaking in the light of all the stars aligned

You, you, you, you
I will find you
ah, ah, ah, ah
I will find you

You, you, you, you, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you
I will find you

I will travel the distance in your eyes
Interstellar light years from you
Supernova: we'll fuse when we collide
Awaking in the light of all the stars aligned

Even a well-lit place can hide salvation
A map to a one-man maze that never sees the sun
Where the lost are the heroes
And the thieves are left to drown
But everyone knows by now
Fairy tales are not found
They're written in the walls

As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from

It has begun

Into the dark below
Evading shadows
Blind in a rabbit's hole
We fall beneath the earth
And watch the shell come unraveled
As the seed begins to rise
Embracing its starlit fate as we wait in the night
It's written in the walls

As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from

There's no hate,
There's no love
Only dark skies that hang above
I call your name as I walk alone
Send a signal to guide me home

Light the night up, you're my dark star
And now you're falling away

But I found in you what was lost in me
In a world so cold and empty
I could lie awake just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me

You're the cause,
The antidote
The sinking ship that I could not let go
You led my way then disappeared
How could you just walk away and leave me here?

Light the night up, you're my dark star
And now you're falling away

But I found in you what was lost in me
In a world so cold and empty
I could lie awake just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me

Blinded, I can't do this on my own
You were all I've got, to guide me home

I could lie awake just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me

Dark on me, dark on me
Dark on me, dark on me
Dark on me

I could lie awake just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me
